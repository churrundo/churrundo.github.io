            I'm Juan Pablo, a 30-year-old from Mexico with a background in
            MERN-stack Web Development and Psychology.

          <h3>My Journey</h3>
          <p>
            After several years of struggling with addiction, I decided to
            reboot my life in 2017 by getting into rehab. Right after that, I
            studied Psychology, which allowed me to consolidate my recovery,
            develop my emotional intelligence, and most importantly discover I
            had undiagnosed ADHD. Finally, with some good hard work and some
            more vocational recalibration, I decided to do a Web Development
            bootcamp and move to Berlin.

          <h3>The Blend</h3>
          <p>
            Having experienced life's lows and the transformative power of
            self-awareness and determination, I bring empathy and a user-centric
            approach to my projects. I understand the importance of
            accessibility, intuitive design, and the overall human experience in
            digital spaces. All of this, with a dash of methylphenidate, gets
            you a driven, curious, gentle, handsome, and witty addition to your
            team.

          <h3>Life Beyond Code</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not optimizing my LinkedIn with ChatGPT or looking at
            YouTube tutorials for obscure technologies I don't even know the use
            cases of, I am usually reading one of my preferred bloggers, eating
            with my gf at the next restaurant on our to-try list, scratching my
            dog's belly, or curating memes and tiktoks.
